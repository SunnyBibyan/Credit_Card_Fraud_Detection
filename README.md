# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is highly imbalanced, with a small percentage of transactions classified as fraud. To address this imbalance, we apply **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)** to balance the dataset before training models like **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree**.

## Project Overview

Fraud detection is critical for financial institutions to prevent losses and protect customers. In this project, we:

- Explore and analyze the credit card transactions dataset.
- Apply SMOTE to handle the imbalanced data problem.
- Train and evaluate Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.
- Use evaluation metrics like **Confusion Matrix**, **ROC-AUC score**, and **Classification Report** to measure model performance.
